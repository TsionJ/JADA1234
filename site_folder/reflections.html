  In this quarter I  have been learning about how to create my own websites. When I first started I had no idea how entering the codes.
  HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language, which is just a fancy way of saying that it defines the layout of a particular Web 
  document which includes a website or a webpage by using different tags and codes. Every code is unique in its own way and using the
  wrong text can cause it not to work properly. The structure for using HTML is one very crucical thing to note is that the first 
  “html” of the webpage does not have a / but the last one does. This is so because the on the last html indicates that that is the 
  end of the section. This rule also applies when you are using body. Although, those are not the only codes that are used when making a website.

  When using Dreamweaver, as soon as you begin typing a new HTML, hundreds of different tags pop up right
  beneath it. This is very helpful because it is an easier way for you to find the tag you are looking for, as well as look for one if you 
  did not know about it. These different tags that pop up are the resources that help you design the page in the layout and format that you want. 
  These tools can also lead you to other hyperlinked texts that will connect you to other webpages and sites. There is also a tool called the HTML 
  editor, which inserts different codes as you create different HTML files.
   </p>

   I also used CSS, which is short for Cascading Style Sheets. What CSS does is a style sheet language that describes the presentation semantics of a document. 
   The difference between HTML and CSS is the HTML is used to structure content, while CSS is used for formatting structured content. CSS gives more liberty to 
   design and develop unique looks for the webpage. I have to admit though that I do not know that much about CSS because we focused mainly on HTML because 
   it was more simplistic.
