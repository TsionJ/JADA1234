			 Testimonial section is given right below the skill section to improve the credibility factor.
			 In the testimonial, you have the option to show your client images, which encourages the new visitors to believe in your work.
			 The top navigation bar is actually a sticky bar, but the developer of this template has made it to appear only on hovering over the green line; 
			 this design provides the visitors a distraction-free environment and also provides a better user experience. 
			 A tabbed interface is followed in the portfolio section so that you can easily organize your project.
